            <p id="tribute-info" class="tributeInfo">Hammocks (derived from other words with other letters) are sling-like apparatuses that are made from various materials depending on whom has manufactured the <a id="tribute-link" class="tributeLink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hammocks.com">Hammock</a> and whether their intentions are pure or not. If impure, the Hammock will undoubtedly be made from materials that are unsustainable or require exploitation of the land or locals. These hammocks ae also almost exclusively used for swinging and not resting or sleeping. Hammocks should never be used for swinging or horseplay, of any kind. Such actions are dangerous and cast disrespect toward the Hammock craftsman whose ancestors lost their lives during swing-chair wars of the 1720’s, 30’s, 40’s and 50’s.
                For those of us who do not worship evil deities and use Hammocks for relaxation instead of recreation – sitting and watching the surrounding area and/or wildlife is acceptable provided, one, all swinging motion be avoided, and two, smiling is to take place no more often than twice, per minute, or Four (4) times per Six (6) hours, whichever is less – we can all feel free to meet here as often as you would like to look at this photo, nah, this relaxing-looking photo and the link to Hammock.com which is basically petty useless.
                On a rarely seriously note: Did you know all National Parks don’t enforce – or actually even have, the same laws and regulations regarding Hammocks? Always check with NPS.gov to make sure you maintain compliance on your next adventure.</p>
